#Given 3 int values, a b c, return their sum. However, if any of the values is a teen -- in the range 13..19 inclusive -- then that value counts as 0, except 15 and 16 do not count as a teens. Write a separate helper "def fix_teen(n):"that takes in an int value and returns that value fixed for the teen rule. In this way, you avoid repeating the teen code 3 times (i.e. "decomposition"). Define the helper below and at the same indent level as the main no_teen_sum().

def fixTeen(x):
  if x % 13 == 0 or x % 14 == 0 or x % 17 == 0 or x % 18 == 0 or x % 19 == 0:
    return 0
  else:
    return x

def no_teen_sum(a, b, c):
  return fixTeen(a)+fixTeen(b)+fixTeen(c)
