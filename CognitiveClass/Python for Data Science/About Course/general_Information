A FEW THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT THIS COURSE

This course is self-paced. There is no instructor to follow or to rush you along - you learn on your own schedule. This also means you are going to need to be disciplined in your studies.
You can start it at any time and you can take as long as you need to complete it. Your place in the course will be remembered and your labs will be saved. However, we strongly recommend that you don't take prolonged breaks between lessons as the mind tends to forget what it does not practice.
You can take the course (audit) as many times as you wish.
There is only ONE chance to pass the course, but you can make multiple attempts per question (see the Grading Scheme section for details)
This is a hands-on course where you will gain practical skill by doing hands-on labs. We provide a a complete virtual lab environment on the cloud that you can access from anywhere as long as you have internet connection.
We strongly recommend that you use Chrome or Firefox browser
